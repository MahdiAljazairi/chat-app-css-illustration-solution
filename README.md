## My process

### Hardest part

Strangely enough, the hardest part of building this page was the background. Not the illustration itself. Mostly because at first, I decided to do it with pseudo-elements instead of a `background-image` inorder to achieve a responsible background. The decision which resulted in scrolling issues because the pseudo-elements had to extend out of the viewport, but not out of the body -so they scroll vertically on mobiles.

Eventually I realized setting multiple background images was the best approach for such situation. But the perfectionist inside me is still unconvinced though üòê.

### What I learned

The `transform` property doesn't change the proportions of an element..  
That's the reason for the first issue in the next section.

### Known issues

- Not suitable for landscape displays with less than 650px height viewport.
- Styles contain plenty of _Magical Numbers_ ü™Ñ.
- No animation.

### Continued development

I need to speed up the process. That's it imo.

## Tools

- [Dev Docs](https://devdocs.io) - The resource I was constantly referring to throughout the process. It's an offline web app that has a huge collection of documentations.
- [Brackets](https://brackets.io) - My text editor. Not as powerful as VSCode, but still my favorite.
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - An open-source SVG editing software. I used it to make the icons and the background of the page. Yup, all icons are original üôÇ.
- Chrome - This web page was only tested on Chrome.
